            <p>This dice roller was the first complete project that I made. There are many things I would do differently if I did it again, it did teach me a lot.</p>
            <a href="Scoreboard/scoreboard.html">Scoreboard</a>
            <p>As of writing this, this scoreboard is my most recent project. I wanted to make something that my friends and I could use for games, trivia, and other activities.
                I learnt many new concepts in JS during the course of this project. The biggest thing I learnt was how to dynamically create content based on user input.
